                    <h2>How can literacy improve lives? Here are 5 ways:</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>
                                Literacy lifts individuals out of poverty
                            </h3>
                            <p>Lacking basic reading and writing skills is a tremendous disadvantage. Literacy not only
                                enriches an individual’s life, but it creates opportunities for people to develop skills
                                that
                                will help them provide for themselves and their family.
                                Literacy improves the development of the wider community</p>

                            <p>The positive knock-on effect of educating girls can be seen in the wider social and
                                economic
                                benefits yielded for their communities. Increasing the emphasis towards women’s
                                education
                                positively impacts on each generation through raised expectations and increased
                                self-esteem.
                                Improving literacy facilitates employment whereby both males and females can contribute,
                                helping
                                the wider economy and community to thrive.
                                Literacy reduces infant mortality rates

                            <p>Illiteracy directly affects an individual’s health and wellbeing, so the importance of
                                education
                                on physical health is vital. Those without education are more likely to be vulnerable to
                                health
                                problems, for example increased schooling reduces the risk of HIV infection. According
                                to one
                                study of women in 32 countries: literate women are three times more likely than
                                illiterate ones
                                to know that a person in seemingly good health can be infected with HIV, and four times
                                as
                                likely to know how to protect themselves from AIDS.</p>

                            <p>Infant mortality rates drop significantly for women who have had primary education, and
                                even
                                more for those who complete secondary school. It is estimated that infant mortality
                                decreases 9%
                                for every year of education attained. This is because girls and women are able to
                                educate
                                themselves on health issues, which can help reduce the cycle of poverty and mortality
                                rates in
                                the long term.</p>

                            </h3>
                            <p>The global illiterate population of young girls is 61.9 per cent so the importance of
                                education
                                for women cannot be understated.</p>

                            <p>Breaking the cycle of illiteracy and improving self-esteem is crucial for women and girls
                                in the
                                developing world. By enabling them to become economically productive and independent,
                                they
                                become empowered and can take control of their lives. The importance of education in
                                fostering
                                personal autonomy, and creative and critical thinking skills is central to helping girls
                                contribute to their societies.</p>

                            <p>The impact of improving literacy in girls not only has a positive economic impact at a
                                local and
                                community level, but the productivity of the workforce flourishes at country level too
